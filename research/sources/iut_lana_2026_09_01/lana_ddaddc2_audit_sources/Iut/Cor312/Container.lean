# The large volume container (taxis #43)

The **large volume container** of the Corollary 3.12 variant (taxis #33) is the
project's name for the combination of

1. the combinatorics of processions and capsules with their label sets `S_{j+1}`
   (IUT I, §§4–6; `Iut.Procession`), and
2. the local and global tensor-packets of log-shells
   (IUT III, Propositions 3.1–3.3 and 3.9; Hoshi, *Introduction to inter-universal
   Teichmüller theory (continued)*, §13).

"Large volume container" is project terminology, not the name of a single definition in
IUT III; this module documents exactly how the Lean abstraction corresponds to the
processions, tensor-packets and integral structures of the papers.

## Correspondence with IUT III, Propositions 3.1–3.3

For a capsule `S` of the procession and a rational place `v_Q`, the tensor-packet of
IUT III, Propositions 3.1–3.2 is the tensor product over the labels `j ∈ S` of the
direct sums `⊕_{v ∣ v_Q} log(F_v)` of local fields lying over `v_Q`. Expanding the
tensor product over the direct sums, the packet decomposes as a direct sum indexed by
the **tuples of places** `(v_j)_{j ∈ S}` with `v_j ∣ v_Q`, each summand a tensor
product of local fields presented as a direct sum of fields. Accordingly:

* the component index of the packet presentation at `(i, v_Q)` is *literally* the type
  `(capsule i).LabelType → fiber v_Q` of such tuples (`LargeVolumeContainerData.packet`),
  so the API retains both the `v_Q`-level direct-sum decomposition over `v ∣ v_Q` and
  the procession labels — replacing this by an unindexed product over `v ∈ V` would
  lose data used by the indeterminacies and by the log-volume (taxis #43, #44);
* the mono-analytic log-shell integral structures placed inside the packets
  (IUT III, Proposition 3.2) appear as the regions `logShell`, product regions which
  are relatively compact, agree with the holomorphic integral region at all but
  finitely many `v_Q` (only ramified and archimedean places contribute; cf. IUT I,
  Definition 5.4.5), and contain the holomorphic integral region at nonarchimedean
  places;
* nonarchimedean and archimedean places are treated separately: the index type
  `Iut.RationalPlace` distinguishes them, the containment
  `integral_subset_logShell_nonarch` is imposed only at nonarchimedean places, and the
  archimedean normalization (Hermitian metric, unit ball) is recorded by the
  log-volume interface of taxis #44.

## Honesty boundary

The *construction* of the packet presentations from actual completions of a number
field — direct sums over `v ∣ v_Q`, tensor products over the capsule labels, semisimple
decomposition, and the log-shells themselves via the `p`-adic logarithm — is local-field
infrastructure tracked in taxis #4 (`lana-agents/padic-log-volume`). Here each packet
presentation enters as an explicit structure field; nothing asserts that a theta-pilot
image lies in the container, and no multiradial algorithm is constructed (out of scope
for taxis #43).

## The global container and admissible regions

The global container is the **restricted product** of the packet totals with respect to
the holomorphic integral regions (`LargeVolumeContainerData.Container`), not a naive
infinite product. The class of admissible regions (`AdmissibleRegion`) consists of
families of packet regions equal to the holomorphic integral region for all but
finitely many `v_Q`; direct-product [pre-]regions and Borel regions are distinguished
by the predicates `AdmissibleRegion.IsProductFamily` and `AdmissibleRegion.IsBorelFamily`
(IUT III, Remark 3.9.5(ii)).
