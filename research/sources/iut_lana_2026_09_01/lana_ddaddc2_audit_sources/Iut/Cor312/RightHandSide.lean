# The right-hand side of the Corollary 3.12 variant (taxis #35)

The **theta-pilot side** `−|log(Θ)|` of the project-owner-specified variant of IUT III,
Corollary 3.12 (taxis #33), composing the ingredient interfaces in the order of
IUT III, Corollary 3.12 itself:

1. **initial Θ-data** (taxis #38) supplies the prime `ℓ`, the `ℓ`-torsion field `K`
   and its places;
2. **Tate `q`-parameters** (taxis #37) enter through the Θ-data (they are consumed by
   the left-hand side, taxis #34; the right-hand side shares the same Θ-data);
3. the **large volume container** (taxis #43) is instantiated over the places of `K`
   with the standard procession of length `ℓ* = (ℓ−1)/2`;
4. a **theta-pilot region** — an admissible region of the container for each capsule,
   representing the union of the images of the theta-pilot under the indeterminacies
   `(Ind1)`, `(Ind2)`, `(Ind3)` of IUT III, Theorem 3.11 — enters as *data*: the
   multiradial algorithm that produces it is out of scope for this repository
   (taxis #43), so the region is an explicit input, with its containment in the
   log-shells recorded as an explicit hypothesis (not proved);
5. the **holomorphic hull** (taxis #45) is applied capsule-wise;
6. the **procession-normalized log-volume** (taxis #44) of the hull is the value.

The composed order — container → indeterminacy-closed region → holomorphic hull →
procession-normalized log-volume — is the order of IUT III, Corollary 3.12
(`−|log(Θ)|` is the procession-normalized log-volume of the holomorphic hull of the
union of theta-pilot images). The ingredient list is not treated as a proof, and
nothing here asserts that the project variant is literally identical to the printed
IUT formulation.

## Compatibility fields

The container is tied to the Θ-data by explicit compatibility fields: the procession
is the standard one of length `ℓ*`, and the place map of the container matches the
places of `K` (by residue characteristic at finite places, and sending infinite places
to the archimedean rational place). Each is a visible assumption, never silently
assumed.
